# Wireframe
A content reference wireframe describes how the wireframes deal with content: they simply refer to it as opposed to depicting it. The key is to avoid plugging in actual contnet at this stage and instead refer to specific peices of content. Low-fi content reference wireframes will eventually evolve into into hi-fi <a href="prototype.html">prototypes</a> that can be studied, tested, and client-approved. <em>Hay Stephen (2013-04-02).

## Mobile First
>"The absence of support for media queries is in fact the first media query" - [Bryan Rieger](http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu)

The idea is to remain abstract at this stage in order to avoid any conversations about laying out specific peices of content and instead focus on content hierarcy and also high-level [content chorography](http://trentwalton.com/2011/07/14/content-choreography/) of major site sections or blocks. Referencing content, rather than using it directly, also keeps breakpoints very simple and postpones those types of decisions until a more appropraite time in the process.
