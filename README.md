#Style-Docs

A framwork for building responsive design deliverables and styleguides in the browser.

## Moving parts

Dexy relies on Python, so you'll need that. You'll also need [Dexy](http://dexy.it). Screenshots are made using [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), so those will have to be installed as well. You can use Dexy's Markdown filter for Markdown conversion, but I use [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for this demo. It's almost as awesome as Dexy.

In addition, the syntax I use for marking blocks of CSS rely on Ana Nelson's [idiopidae-fork](https://bitbucket.org/ananelson/idiopidae-fork).
