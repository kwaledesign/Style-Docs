[hi-fi example](http://pgh-pilgrimage.herokuapp.com/)

When we show our clients wireframes, we ask them for content-oriented feedback:

Are we missing any important chunks? How about the relative importance of the chunks that are there? Does this seem like the raw information this page needs?

At this stage weâ€™re trying to make sure we have all the stuff we need on the page before we start designing it.
