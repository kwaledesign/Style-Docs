# Wireframe
A content reference wireframe describes how the wireframes deal with content: they simply refer to it as opposed to depicting it. The key is to avoid plugging in actual contnet at this stage and instead refer to specific peices of content. Low-fi content reference wireframes will eventually evolve into into hi-fi <a href="prototype.html">prototypes</a> that can be studied, tested, and client-approved. <em>Hay Stephen (2013-04-02).
