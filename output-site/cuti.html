<h1 id="c.u.t.i.-report">C.U.T.I. Report</h1>
<p>A &quot;Cuti&quot; report is a User Experience document that identifies a site's Content, Users (and user contexts), Tasks, and Interactions. User Experience methodoligies can vary a great deal based on personal preference and project requierments, but they all boil down to a few fundamental definitions. The CUTI report summarizes these definitions in order to keep these findings front and center in order to allow for UX to steer the design and development process.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>Content inventories are easiest to start as a free form list and then introduce more structure and orginization into content types, blocks, and views.</p>
<h3 id="content-strategy">Content Strategy</h3>
<p>Explicit plan for the creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable, content. Where is each piece of content coming from? How is content going to be maintained throughout the entire content life cycle (plan/create/edit/deliver/govern).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Content Inventory - what is there? where does it live? who owns it?</p></li>
<li>Content Audit - Ask &quot;why?&quot;. Clarify the purpose for every piece of content and prioritize everything to identify what supports user tasks/goals and what does not. Eliminate or hide everything that does not have essential value. Question everything (why? what? how? for whom? by whom? with what? when? where? how often? what next?) early and often.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>who's using it?</li>
<li>where are content delivery points?</li>
<li>what is the workflow?</li>
</ul>
<p>Goal: Identify high quality, high relevant content from the user's perspective.</p>
<p>Also consider content contributers * writting for the web * rollout calendar * oversight / editorial control (<a href="http://voiceandtone.com/">voice and tone</a>)</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Alignment
<ul>
<li>Govern</li>
<li>Create</li>
<li>Deliver</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>When content strategy is effectively and consistently implemented you encourage:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Better user experience</p></li>
<li><p>Better brand consistency</p></li>
<li><p>Increased operational effeciencies through better controls and workflow</p></li>
<li><p>Improved SEO and analytics</p></li>
<li><p>More effective personalization which leads to increased user engagement (emotional design)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Content better serves end users and becomes an asset rather than a commodity.</p>
<h2 id="users-and-user-contexts">Users and User Contexts</h2>
<p>Define users along with user hierarchy of needs within the context of interacting with site content. Represent this information in a specific user interaction with site content in a way that informs the actual build/implementation.</p>
<h2 id="user-tasks">User Tasks</h2>
<p>After identifying users, user contexts, and major content types - these can be mapped to specific user tasks that begin to inform specific site functionality requirements and potential solutions.</p>
<h2 id="interactions">Interactions</h2>
<p>Design interfaces for the process of interacting with the data, not the data itself. Articulate how the user can understand where they are in a process after effecting a change. To do this effectively, first identify:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What is the goal? - the purpose for using an interface.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the process? - the path to accomplishing the goal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Additional considerations include what is the appropriate information and what is the appropriate placement of this information in the interface? For example, given a large amount of data, what information will the user already have and how can that information be used to drill further into the data base in order to eliminate non-essential information and display the essential information in a way that facilitates the accomplishment of the user's goal.</p>
<p>In order for an interaction to be effective it must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Communicate what can be changed</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate how to effect change</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate that a change has happened and the contextual location within the process</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Identify pre-existing processes and interaction points. Look for steps that can be optimized or automated to discover the minimum set of actions required for user to accomplish their part of the process in order to eliminate friction.</p>
<p>Must first identify the data and understand all the use cases for the data and the potential actions users might need to take. Without understanding the process, you cannot design the interface.</p>
