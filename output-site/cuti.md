# C.U.T.I. Report
A "Cuti" report is a User Experience document that identifies a site's Content, Users (and user contexts), Tasks, and Interactions. User Experience methodoligies can vary a great deal based on personal preference and project requierments, but they all boil down to a few fundamental definitions. The CUTI report summarizes these definitions in order to keep these findings front and center in order to allow for UX to steer the design and development process.
