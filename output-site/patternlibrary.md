# Pattern Library

The pattern library includes all the components defined within the styleguide, in addition to the actual code snippets (HTML/CSS/JS). It can also be helpful to include both the Sass and CSS code, which is especially useful when parts of a component are generated by a mixin or function and the generated CSS isn't particularly clear.


# Button HTML:
{{ highlight(d['components/sections.html|htmlsections']['buttons'], "html") }}

# Sass Header:
{{ d['sass/style-docs/_components.scss|idio']['sass-header'] }}

# Button CSS:

# Buttons:
{{ (d['components/sections.html|htmlsections']['buttons']) }}

</div>
