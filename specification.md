# Specification Document

The specification document spells out the goals and strategies for the project. It’s the victory list and the game plan.

Getting an early version of this document into your clients’ hands is essential. Make sure each and every stakeholder knows how important this is, and has read it and given their thoughts or concerns before you continue. I suggest a message like this:

Participating in the writing of the specification document now means your ideas will be incorporated into the final product. Please make sure anyone that needs to weigh in later reviews this document. Let them know: if the outcome of this project is important to you, we need your feedback on the spec doc by next Friday!

Often these suggested edits spark new conversations about what’s important to accomplish on the project. If someone’s idea for a feature or approach sounds off-base to you, ask why they think it’s crucial. How does it relate to the project goals? If it doesn’t, do you need to revise the goals, or does this stakeholder just need to be reminded of the big picture?

Once these key plans are in place (and everyone on the team is finished making edits), we have what we need to start getting visual.


Clearly defines scope and serves as a reference point to avoid feature creep.
